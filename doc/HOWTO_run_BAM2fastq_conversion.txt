For each <machine> in the CERNmachine_list.txt file do:
   - ssh mfalchi@<machine>
   - cdshare          # not a typo, it is an alias
   - Run the RUN_FASTQ.sh command:
        ./RUN_FASTQ.sh
   - To see if the processes run use:
        ./PS.sh
   - In case you want/need to terminate the run do:
        ./KILL.sh

OR 

For each machine in the CERNmachine_list.txt file with number in [0,3]:
	ssh the machine
	access the folder /oplashare/data/mfalchi/GeneROOT/script/BAM2fastq
	run the run_bamToFastq.sh script using the following command:
		nohup sh ./run_bamToFastq.sh N &> /eos/genome/local/14007a/logs/log_machineN_YYYYMMDDhhmm.log & 
	where N is the machine number YYYYMMDDhhdd is the date and time of the execution 
	(e.g., 201612071052)
