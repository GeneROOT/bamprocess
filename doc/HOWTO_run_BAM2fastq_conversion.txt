For each <machine> in the CERNmachine_list.txt file do:
   - ssh mfalchi@<machine>
   - cdshare          # not a typo, it is an alias
   - Run the RUN_FASTQ.sh command:
        ./RUN_FASTQ.sh
   - To see if the processes run use:
        ./PS.sh
   - In case you want/need to terminate the run do:
        ./KILL.sh
