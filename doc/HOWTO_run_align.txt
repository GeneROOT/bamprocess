For each machine in the CERNmachine_list.txt file with number in [0,5]:
	ssh the machine
	run the run_align.sh script using the following command:
		nohup sh /oplashare/data/mfalchi/GeneROOT/bamprocess/script/align/run_align.sh N Njobs &> /eos/genome/local/14007a/logs2/log_machineN_YYYYMMDDhhmm.log & 
	where N is the machine number, Njobs is the number of jobs (2 for all but opladev47.cern.ch, 
	where we can run 8) and YYYYMMDDhhdd is the date and time of the execution 
	(e.g., 201612071052)
